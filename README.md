# Flickr Photo Stream

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.

A Flickr Photo Stream web app, created using the Flickr API.
It covers the basic requirements of the task, has an infinite scroll, allows dynamic searching by tags and also allows images to pop up in a modal window, when clicked on.

The CSS styling was definitely not the top priority here.


## How to run

To run the app an, install of the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart#prerequisites) is required. Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x, and the npm client command line interface.

To install Angular simply run:

 npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Run `ng serve --open` inside the top directory of the repository for a dev server. The web app will be opened at `http://localhost:4200/`.
